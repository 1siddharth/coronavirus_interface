                        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus
                        that attacks the
                        respiratory track of a person. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva
                        or discharge from the
                        nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice
                        respiratory etiquette (for
                        example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). At this time, there are no specific vaccines or
                        treatments for COVID-19.
                        However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments.

                        Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever,
                        cough, fatigue, and
                        shortness of breath. Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent
                        chest pain or pressure,
                        confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if
                        these symptoms are
                        present. Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore
                        throat may be seen.
                        Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying
                        percentages.
                        Some cases in China initially presented only with chest tightness and palpitations. In some,
                        the disease may
                        progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death. In those who develop severe
                        symptoms, time from symptom
                        onset to needing mechanical ventilation is typically eight days.

                        Coronaviruses can also pass into the brain, causing neurological symptoms which may include
                        headaches, dizziness, loss
                        of smell and taste, and fatigue. Loss of smell was identified as a common early symptom of
                        COVID-19 in March
                        2020, although not as common as initially reported.

                        As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment when a person is infected with
                        the virus and the time
                        when they develop symptoms. This is called the incubation period. The incubation period for
                        COVID-19 is typically five
                        to six days but may range from two to 14 days. 97.5% of people who develop symptoms will
                        do so within 11.5 days
                        of infection.

                        Reports indicate that not all who are infected develop symptoms. The role of these asymptomatic
                        carriers in transmission
                        is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to
                        the spread of the
                        disease. The proportion of infected people who do not display symptoms is currently
                        unknown and being studied,
                        with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all
                        confirmed cases remained
                        asymptomatic during their hospital stay. China's National Health Commission began
                        including asymptomatic cases
                        in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at
                        the time of
                        testing.[53]

                        Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded
                        places, washing hands
                        with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene and
                        avoiding touching the
                        eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. The CDC recommends covering the mouth
                        and nose with a tissue
                        when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is
                        available.Proper hand
                        hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged. The CDC has recommended the use of cloth
                        face coverings in public
                        settings, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.

                        Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by
                        closing schools and
                        workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings. Distancing
                        guidelines also include that
                        people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart. There is no medication known to be effective at
                        preventing
                        COVID-19.

                        public where people facing issues related to Covid19 can register themselves and provide their
                        health status and their location can be taken using maps.
                        Similarly, it should be accessible to health workers through which they can separate individuals
